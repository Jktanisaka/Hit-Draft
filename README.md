# HitDraft.XYZ

HitDraft is an application I developed to help streamers run hit drafts.

## What is a hit draft?
A hit draft (sometimes known as a group break) is when multiple people buy in to have a streamer open trading cards for them. Once the streamer opens the cards the participants will be randomly ordered to pick from the selection. Each person will get a turn to pick a card to keep, often going in snake-order.

## How does HitDraft.XYZ work?
1. Streamer selects size of draft and enters name of participants
2. Streamer will start the game, which will randomly decide the order
3. Once the order is decided, the streamer can enter the card the participant chooses
4. Once the draft is filled out, the draft can be named and saved as a CSV file

## Additional features
- Draft will save values upon page reload
- User can only start a new race by clicking the "start a new draft" button
- If the page is reloaded, the default behavior is to display any existing draft
